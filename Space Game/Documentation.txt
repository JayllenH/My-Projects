My additional feature is the inclusion of a bonus collectible. 
These collectibles inherit from the Collectible class into the class gameObject.
These bonus collectible are NOT included as part of the required collectible to move to another level.
The first special collectible is an extra point collectible: collecting this grants the user an extra 5 points.
Every 5 Levels the bonus collectible shows up!
These bonus collectibles appear different than the “regular” collectibles. 
The bonus is the planet earth !!
